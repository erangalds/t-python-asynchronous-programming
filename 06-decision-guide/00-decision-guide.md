# Decision Guide

## Choosing the Right Tool

Here's a summary to help you decide which concurrency mechanism to use:

| Scenario                                                    | Best Tool(s)                                                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I/O-bound tasks (many small/medium concurrent waits)**    | `asyncio` (`async`/`await`)                                        | **Highly recommended.** `asyncio` is designed for this. It has very low overhead per context switch and efficiently handles thousands of concurrent I/O operations in a single thread by yielding control during waits. Ideal for network requests, database calls, web servers (FastAPI!).                                                                          |
| **I/O-bound tasks (fewer, longer concurrent waits)**        | `threading` / `ThreadPoolExecutor`                                 | Also suitable. Threads are simpler to grasp for some, and the GIL is released during I/O. `ThreadPoolExecutor`provides a high-level API. Good for downloading a few large files or interacting with a limited number of external services. Can be easier to integrate with existing blocking code.                                                                   |
| **CPU-bound tasks (heavy computations)**                    | `multiprocessing` / `ProcessPoolExecutor`                          | **Highly recommended.** Bypasses the GIL, allowing true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores. Essential for numerical computations, data processing, image/video manipulation where Python code itself is the bottleneck.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Mixed I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks**                     | Combination of `asyncio` and `multiprocessing.ProcessPoolExecutor` | A common advanced pattern: Use `asyncio` for the I/O-bound parts (e.g., handling many web requests). When a CPU-bound task needs to be performed, offload it to a `ProcessPoolExecutor` using `loop.run_in_executor()`from within your `asyncio` code. This prevents blocking the event loop.                                                                        |
| **Simple background task (blocking)**                       | `threading` / `ThreadPoolExecutor`                                 | If you have a single blocking function that needs to run in the background without holding up your main program, a simple `threading.Thread` or `ThreadPoolExecutor` can suffice.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Building a highly concurrent web service (like FastAPI)** | `asyncio` (FastAPI is built on it)                                 | FastAPI inherently leverages `asyncio` for its non-blocking I/O. When you define `async def` endpoints, FastAPI runs them on its event loop. If you have blocking (non-async) code in an endpoint, FastAPI will automatically run it in a thread pool (via `run_in_executor` internally) to avoid blocking the event loop. This is why understanding both is useful. |



### Practical Scenarios

- **Scenario 1: Downloading 100 images from various websites.**
    
    - **Best:** `asyncio` with `aiohttp`. Fast, low overhead for many concurrent connections.
    - **Alternative:** `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Also effective, but might have slightly higher overhead.
- **Scenario 2: Processing a large dataset by applying a complex mathematical function to each element.**
    
    - **Best:** `ProcessPoolExecutor`. Leverages multiple CPU cores for parallel computation.
    - **Worst:** `threading` module (for CPU-bound). GIL will bottleneck.
- **Scenario 3: Building a real-time chat application with WebSockets.**
    
    - **Best:** `asyncio`. Designed for persistent, concurrent connections and event-driven architectures.
- **Scenario 4: Running a background task that takes 5 seconds to query an external legacy database (blocking driver).**
    
    - **Best:** `threading` or `ThreadPoolExecutor`. The database query is I/O-bound, so GIL isn't an issue during the wait.
    - **If integrated with `asyncio`:** Use `loop.run_in_executor(None, blocking_db_call)`.
